# 0.3: HTML forms

Summary of tutorial from Mozilla: [Your first form](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Your_first_form)

Forms allow users to enter data, which is generally sent to a web server or used on the client-side to immediately update the interface.
A web's forms HTML is made up of one more **form controls**. These along with some other elements to strucure the overall form are 
referred to as **HTML forms**. The form controls are mostly `<input>` elements and can vary between text, buttons, checkboxes, etc. 
using its `type` attribute. `<textarea>` is a separate element.
 
 ### Form attributes
```
<form action="/my-handling-form-page" method="post">
</form>
```
- *action*: URL where the form's collected data should be sent
- *method*: HTTP method to send the data with (usually get or post)

### Snippet
```
<form action="/my-handling-form-page" method="post">
  <label for="name">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="user_name">
  <input type="submit" value="Send message">
</form>
```
The `for` attribute of `<label>` binds it to the corresponding input (given by its id). 
`<input>` elements of type submit are rendered as buttons. Clicking it sends the form's data to 
the web page defined by the action attribute.
