Empty elements are the exception which do not have a closing tag or inner content. The img tag is one example. 

Elements may also have **attributes** which provide more information to change appearance or behavior. 
Attributes follow the element name (or other attributes if multiple). The syntax is `name="value"`.

Elements can and often are **nested** as seen in below template.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>

```
